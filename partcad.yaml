      PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymer.
      Made from cornstarch or sugarcane it is tough and resistant while also being biodegradable.
      However, this origin can cause it to not be resistant to water or chemicals.

      ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is an amphorus thermoplastic polymer known for its durability and impact resistance.
      Parts made from this material will hold up well to wear and tear.
      A common example of an ABS material are LEGO building blocks.
      ABS is composed of about 50% styrene with various amounts of butadiene and acrylonitrile.
      The styrene provides the strength in this molecule, while the butadiene provides toughness,
      and the acrylonitrile provideds the chemical resistance and heat stablitity.

      Nylon (Polyamide), or PA, is a semi-crystaline polymer made from two monomers with each monomer containing six carbon atoms.
      There is another form of Nylon that has twelve carbon atoms.
      The amount of carbon atoms effects the stiffness of the material and the melting point.
      It is tough, flexible, and non-biodegradable.
      However, due to its structure it is prone to absorb water which causes a chemical change of the material and effects the material properties.
